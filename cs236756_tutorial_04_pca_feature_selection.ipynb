    "* Dimensionality Reduction vs. **Feature Selection**\n",
    "    * Differs from feature selection in 2 ways:\n",
    "        1. Instead of choosing subset of features, it creates new features (dimensions) defined as functions over all features\n",
    "        2. Does not consider class labels, just data points\n",
    "* Main Idea:\n",
    "    * Given data points in **d**-dimensional space\n",
    "    * Project the data points into lower dimensional space while **preserving as much information as possible**\n",
    "        * For example, find the best 2-D approximation to 3/4/104-D data\n",
    "    * In particular, choose the projection that minimizes the squared error in reconstruction of the original data\n",
    "* Example (from the presentation):\n",
    "    * Assunmption: Data lies on or near a low *d*-dimensional subspace\n",
    "    * Axes of this subspace are effective representation of the data\n",

    "PCA is a method for reducing the dimensionality of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses simple matrix operations from linear algebra and statistics to calculate a projection of the original data into the same number or fewer dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define 2 goals PCA wishes to achieve:\n",
    "1. Find linearly independent dimensions (or basis of views) which can losslessly represent the data points.\n",
    "2. Those newly found dimensions should allow us to predict/reconstruct the original dimensions. **The reconstruction/projection error should be minimized.**\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, PCA finds a new set of dimensions (or a set of basis of views) such that all the dimensions are **orthogonal** (and hence linearly independent) and ranked according to the variance of data along them. It means that the more important principle axis occurs first (more important = more variance/more spread out data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recap of some basics:\n",
    "* **Variance** - a measure of the variability. Mathematically, it is the average squared deviation from the mean score. We use the following formula to compute variance: $var(x) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\mu_x)^2$ where $\\mu_x$ is the mean.\n",
    "* **Covaraince** - a measure of the extent to which corresponding elements from two sets of ordered data move in the same direction. We use the following formula to compute variance: $cov(x, y) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\mu_x)(y_i-\\mu_y)$.\n",
    "* **Covariance matrix** - includes the variance of dimensions on the main diagonal and the rest is the covariance between dimensions. If we have $N$ data points (samples) with $d$ dimensions for each sample and $X$ is an $dxN$ matrix, then:\n",
    "$Cov(X) = \\frac{1}{N}(X-\\mu_X)(X-\\mu_X)^T$ (in PCA, we wish this matrix to be diagonal). We assume the data is centered, thus: $Cov(X) = \\frac{1}{N}XX^T$\n",
