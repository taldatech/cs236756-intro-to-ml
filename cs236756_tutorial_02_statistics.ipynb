This would count as a variable. A parameter, on the other hand, will be independent of the variable and the number of cases that are taken to study.

    "\n",
    "3. **P-value & Interpretation** - Compute the P-value, which is the probability that a test statistic, at least as significant as the one observed, would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis were true. The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence **against** the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Significance Level** - Compare the p-value to an acceptable significance value $\\alpha$ (sometimes called an $\\alpha$ value, a probability threshold below which the null hypothesis will be rejected. Common values are 5% and 1%.). If $p \\leq \\alpha$ (the observed effect is statistically significant), the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid.\n",

    "    * This statement of the alternative hypothesis is one-sided. That is, it looks only for values larger than stated under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    * There is another way to state the alternative hypothesis. We could state it in a **“two-sided”** manner, looking for values that are either higher- or lower-than expected. For the current illustrative example, the two-sided alternative is $H_a: \\mu \\neq 170$. Although for the current illustrative example, this seems unnecessary, two-sided alternative offers several advantages and are much more common in practice.\n",
